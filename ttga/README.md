The software TTGA (Topological Tools for Geomorphological Analysis) is a tool which helps the analysis of river systems, 
in particular, braided rivers and estuaries. The focus of the tool is the computation of river networks from a digital 
elevation model (DEM) of the river bed. Such a river network can then be used as input for further analyses, such as 
computing the length or average elevation of channels. More details about the software, how to install it, etc., can be 
found in the [official repository](https://github.com/tue-alga/ttga).

The zip file available here corresponds to version 1.5, for which these pre and post process scripts have been made.
